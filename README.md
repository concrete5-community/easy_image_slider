# Easy Image Slider

## Credits

This add-on has been originally developed by Jacqmin SÃ©bastien ([@myconcretelab](https://github.com/myconcretelab/)).

Since 2020-11-30, he has been so kind to [release it under the MIT license](https://github.com/concrete5-community/easy_image_slider/commit/25ccb0e5417cf2bf3cd6e77ce94cf86430bba523).

After that, we moved the package under the concrete5-community umbrella, so that this package can be managed by a community instead of a single person.

## Installation

You have the following options:
- clone this repository (or a ZIP copy of it) into a `easy_image_slider` directory under the `packages` directory
- using [composer](https://getcomposer.org):
  ```sh
  composer require concrete5-community/easy_image_slider
  ```
